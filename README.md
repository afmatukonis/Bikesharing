# Bikesharing
Module-16

**Overview** 

The purpose of this module was to use Tableau to create visualizations based on Citi Bike use data. First we got familar with Tableau and how to create different graphs and charts, what the difference between worksheets, dashboards, and stories. 

First we were tasked with using jupyter notebook and changing the trip duration column to a DateTime format using Pandas. Once we transformed the trip duration into the correct format we then began to use Tableau to create visualizations on Checkout Times for Users, Checkout Times for Gender, Trips by Weekday for Each Hour, Trips by Gender (Weekday by Hour), Trips by Gender by Weekday. We also created more visualziations during the module itself that we used in the analysis. 

They are all displayed in Tableau here.

We can see here that the most users are male and subscribers rather than customers.

Here the data shows that the max peak time for checkouts is 5 minutes and does not different between male and female riders.

These images show that males are the most active riders, and that the most trips are taken between 6-9 am and 5-7 pm during the week, and on the weekends it between 9am - 7pm.

Here the data shows that the male subscribers are the most active rider, with Thursday being the most popular day.

This data shows that most trips start and end in central Manhatten. 

**Results**

Based on the visualizations we can conclude that the most riders are male and subcribers, most rides last under an hour with checkout times around 5 minutes, the busiest times are between 6-9 am and 5-7 pm, the usual hours before and after work. We can theorize that most riders are riding them to and from work and that they are male. Males subscribers are the most active during the week, with little variation between days. Finally, looking at where the trips start and stop you can see that most of the drips are centralized in Manhattan. We can look closer and see that most of the trips start and stop near major landmarks such as the Empire State Building, One World Trader Center, and Central Park. 

Based on the data visualization we can make recommendations about where to place bike stations, when to service them based on usage hours, and how many bikes would be needed.
